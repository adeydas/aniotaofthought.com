[Before the Flood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5929776/): A depiction of what one may find on the topic of climate change if viewed with an open mind. Here are some facts that shocked me:

1. China is one of the countries with high dependence on fossil fuels and hence higher levels of emissions. However, the situation has come to a point in the last few years that there's wide public discourse and policy changes to accommodate for climate change. They even have live data fed every hour by factories on emission levels, consumable by the public to hold companies accountable.
2. Coral reefs are natural habitat for fish and about a billion people depend on fish as their source of protein. However, 50% of coral reefs have disappeared in the last 30 years due to climate change.
3. Palm oil is used in several products and has resulted in rapid deforestation that has had severe effects on the ecosystem and animal and plant life in countries like Indonesia. There is no reason to get palm oil the way it's done today other than keeping profit margins.
4. Furthuring the topic of tropical deforestation, the foremost reason is the consumption of beef since cows emit methane during grazing. About 10-12% of US emissions is due to beef.
5. Batteries may be a huge step forward to use renewable energy and per Elon Musk, a 100 gigafactories can provide energy for the whole world. The only thing lacking to do so is the political and industrial will.
6. According to NASA astronaut Dr Piers J Sellers' climate simulation models, the greatest drought in the last 900 years could be coming in the next few decades.
